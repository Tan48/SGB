======== Instructions and Install Log for Knuth’s Stanford GraphBase ======== 
               For: Mac OS Version 10.13 or later

The Stanford GraphBase is a set of programs written in the C Language and has
documentation on programs that manipulate data structures called graphs.  Donald
Knuth’s 1993 book “The Stanford GraphBase - A Platform for Combinatorial Computing”
describes these programs in detail as a means to allow others to rewrite the
software and try other methods or to combine graphs with other data structures.

Knuth’s series of books “The Art of Computer Programming” has an extensive amount
of algorithms on combinatorial computing in Volume 4.  Volume 4A was published
in 2011 and two more volumes should follow soon if all goes well.  The Stanford
GraphBase is a good companion for those students wishing to test various routines
that appear in Volume 4A and the ones to follow.  Knuth’s CWEB software is
also useful and its installation is required to implement these programs.

Notes:

1)	This file: “Install GraphBase Mac OS.rtf” is created and maintained using the
	Mac OS “TextEdit” program in the Applications directory.
	See: /Applications/Launchpad.app.

	Any other plain text editor will also work.  It is also distributed as a PDF file.
	The text in blue are links to web sites which you can click on below to see 
	what the link refers to.  The text in red are commands entered on the Mac
	Terminal app which can be invoked by following steps 2a and 2b below.
	Search for “Mac Terminal Commands” for a list of them.  Each terminal command
	has on-line documentation that can be viewed by entering “man <command-name>”.
	You can recall a previously entered command by using the Up-Arrow key and
	the other Arrow keys and the Delete key to modify and resubmit the command.

2)	Before you install the Stanford GraphBase library you must have Knuth’s
	CWEB programs installed.  See: http://macappstore.org/cweb/

	a)	Run the Terminal app (Its icon is at the bottom) or:

	b) 	Press Command+Space and type Terminal and press enter/return key
	     	to enter commands to Mac OS.  Then enter the command (all on the
		same line - Note: ruby is an Interpreted object-oriented scripting language.
		Type “man ruby” for usage.  Homebrew is a software installation program.):

	c) 	ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)" 
			< /dev/null 2> /dev/null

	d) 	Once Homebrew is installed then enter the command:

	e) 	brew install cweb

	f) 	See Step 4) below to optionally install Knuth’s TEX typesetting S/W
		TEX or its variants.  They can be used in CWEB and SGB to typeset the
		output of the CWEAVE program in CWEB.

3)	Download the TAR file that contains the source code and Makefile for the
	Stanford GraphBase library:

	a) 	On Knuth’s GraphBase website at:
		https://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/sgb.html

	b) 	Find the following text (i.e. Available from . . .) on that webpage and
		click on “master sources” and a file sgb.tar will be downloaded into your
		Downloads directory.  Move the TAR file to your source directory and then
		double-click to unpack the archive files into that source directory:

		Available from the publishers, ACM Press or Addison-Wesley Publishing Company.
	
		Public-domain sources for all programs and data of The Stanford GraphBase are freely
		available.  They can be obtained, for example,  by anonymous ftp from the master sources
		on ftp.cs.stanford.edu in directory ~ftp/pub/sgb. The programs are highly portable 
		and have been installed on a wide variety of computers and operating systems.

		There is a Unix style “Makefile” to customize the locations of the
		output files which are generated by the C Compiler. C is available
		as part of Apple’s Xcode integrated development environment.

4)	a) 	Install the TEX files from the following website: 
		http://tug.org/mactex:
		To download, click MacTeX Download. 
		This distribution requires Mac OS 10.13, High Sierra, or higher and runs on Intel processors.
		(Note: the mactex-20200407.pkg file is 4.21 GB)

		- OR for regular TEX and a much smaller install -

	b)	To download the smaller BasicTeX, click Smaller Download. 
		(Note: the mactex-basictex-20200407.pkg file is 83.2 MB)
		Either one or both versions can be downloaded and reside in different
		directories.

In the install log and command line text below, <user-name> refers to your
Apple user name that appears under the /Users directory.  In order to browse
the Apple Directory structure you will need to invoke the “Terminal” app in
your Application directory by clicking on the Launchpad ICON at the bottom.
You can also get to any directory from the Finder app by issuing the
keyboard command sequence <shift> <command> <G key> and entering the full path
name of the directory you wish to view in the the pop-up menu that is displayed.
To see the top level directory, i.e. the root, just enter “/“ as the path and
then to see the contents of that enter the command “ls” to list the subfiles. 

You can also display the environment variables that Mac OS uses such as $PATH,
which is list of directories that is searched to find programs or apps scattered
across several locations.  Launch the Terminal app and enter: SUDO ENV to invoke
a restricted command as a “Super User” and hit return followed by your password
as follows to display these variables:

		My-Mac-Air:Knuth <user-name>$ sudo env
		Password: <enter your login password>
		TERM=xterm-256color
		SSH_AUTH_SOCK=/private/tmp/com.apple.launchd.MKxIwsbBYG/Listeners
		PATH=/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/Library/TeX/texbin
		LANG=en_US.UTF-8
		HOME=/Users/<user-name>
		( . . . and other ENV variables)

Note that the $PATH variable has /Library/TeX/texbin as one of the directories
(where the TEX app is located).  You may also enter the command “cd $HOME/Desktop”
or “cd ~/Desktop” to get to your desktop directory.  The install script Makefile
has terminal commands that compile and install files in difference directories.
It has the following phases by entering “make <phase>” in the terminal app:

My-Mac-Air:/ <user-name>$ make tests		          (checks for existence of install files)
My-Mac-Air:/ <user-name>$ sudo make install       (compiles C source files, and others)
My-Mac-Air:/ <user-name>$ sudo make installdemos  (compiles demo programs and installs them)

In order to install the apps (binary files) in system directories you must run
the command as a Super User (SUDO) and enter the logon password to continue.  The
Makefile has commands in it that specify the installation directories and you
can edit those names to put the files where you wish but it should work OK as is.
In this installation the source files are located in /Users/<user-name>/Desktop/Knuth
in the subdirectories CWEB and “Stanford GraphBase”.
